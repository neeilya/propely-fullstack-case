# Propely Fullstack Engineer Case: Starter repo

A deliberately plain starting point for the technical case assignment. It gives you a
local API serving 1000 property maintenance tasks and a React page that
dumps all of them into a table. Nothing more.

This repo intentionally does **not** contain filtering, search, pagination or PDF
export, and it does not resolve property names. Building that is the assignment (full
requirements at the bottom).

## Getting started

Requires **Node 22 or newer**. Any way of installing it works, and nvm is not required.
If you do use nvm, `.nvmrc` pins the version for you:

```bash
nvm use            # optional, picks up Node 22 from .nvmrc
npm install
```

Then start the two apps in **two separate terminals**:

```bash
npm run dev:api    # terminal 1
npm run dev:web    # terminal 2
```

| App                | URL                                            | Notes                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| API (Express)      | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | run with `tsx`, no build step in dev           |
| Web (Vite + React) | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | proxies nothing; calls the API by absolute URL |

On first start the API creates `apps/api/tasks.db` from `seed/tasks.json` and
`seed/properties.json`. The db file is gitignored and rebuilt from the seed, so you can
always get back to a clean dataset: delete the file and restart the API.

`npm run test` exists and exits 0. There are no tests yet.

## API contract

Current endpoints. You are free to change or replace them (see below).

### `GET /api/health`

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### `GET /api/tasks`

Returns one page of tasks, newest first, with the property name joined in. All query
parameters are optional:

| Param      | Values                                                                       | Default |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `status`   | `New`, `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Rejected`                                 | all     |
| `category` | `FireSafety`, `Plumbing`, `Electrical`, `Ventilation`, `Cleaning`, `Outdoor` | all     |
| `q`        | case-insensitive substring of title, description, property name or id        | none    |
| `page`     | 1-based page number, clamped to the last page                                | `1`     |
| `size`     | rows per page, 1–100                                                         | `25`    |

Unknown `status`/`category` values read as "all". Filters and search combine with AND.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "task-0001",
      "title": "Skifte lyskilder til LED i garasje",
      "description": "Midlertidig løsning på plass. Permanent utbedring gjenstår.",
      "category": "Electrical",
      "status": "InProgress",
      "property_id": "prop-004",
      "property_name": "Åkerveien 3",
      "created_at": "2025-12-25",
      "due_date": "2026-03-01",
      "cost_nok": 8100
    }
  ],
  "total": 1000,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 25
}
```

### `GET /api/tasks.pdf`

Same query parameters as `/api/tasks`, served as a PDF attachment of the task table. With
`size` (and optionally `page`) it exports that page; without `size` it exports every matching
row.

CORS is wide open (all origins), which covers the Vite dev server. There is no auth.

## Data model

Two tables in a single local SQLite file (`better-sqlite3`): `tasks` and `properties`.
`tasks.property_id` is a foreign key into `properties.id`, and the task row holds no property name of its own.

### `properties`

| Column | Type | Null | Notes                                                  |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`   | TEXT | no   | primary key, e.g. `prop-011`                           |
| `name` | TEXT | no   | Norwegian free text, 40 rows, some 70 to 90 chars long |

### `tasks`

| Column        | Type    | Null    | Notes                                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | TEXT    | no      | primary key                                            |
| `title`       | TEXT    | no      | Norwegian free text                                    |
| `description` | TEXT    | no      | Norwegian free text, mostly short, some 400–800 chars  |
| `category`    | TEXT    | no      | enum, CHECK constraint                                 |
| `status`      | TEXT    | no      | enum, CHECK constraint                                 |
| `property_id` | TEXT    | no      | foreign key into `properties.id`, unevenly distributed |
| `created_at`  | TEXT    | no      | ISO 8601 date, spread across 2022–2026                 |
| `due_date`    | TEXT    | **yes** | ISO 8601 date, null in ~19 % of rows                   |
| `cost_nok`    | INTEGER | **yes** | 300 – ~470 000, null in ~12 % of rows                  |

### Seed data

`seed/tasks.json` is the single source of truth for the dataset, and is never
regenerated at runtime. The data is deliberately messy: Norwegian characters, long
property names, long compound words, some very long descriptions, nulls, a wide cost
range and a skewed status distribution (roughly 55 % Completed, 22 % InProgress,
20 % New, 3 % Rejected). Expect it to stress your table layout and formatting.

Please treat `seed/tasks.json` and `seed/properties.json` as fixed input and leave them
as they are. The data is meant to be awkward, and working with it as-is is part of the
exercise.

## Your assignment

Extend the existing task table with new features/improvements. Use no more than 1 to 3 hours.

All five of the following are **required**:

1. **Show the property name, not the id.** The table currently prints the raw
   `property_id` (`prop-011`). It should show the property name (`Åkerveien 3`).
2. **Filtering.** The user must be able to narrow the table by at least `status`,
   `category` and property. Multiple filters must work together.
3. **Search.** A free-text search across some columns (at minimum `title`, and
   ideally `property`_id). It must work together with the filters.
4. **Pagination.** The table must be paginated rather than rendering all 1000 rows at
   once. Page size is up to you.
5. **A "Download as PDF" button** that exports the task table as a PDF. The export must
   reflect what the user is currently looking at, so the active filters and search apply to it.

### How you build it is up to you

- add any dependencies you want
- change the API however you like, including adding, changing or replacing endpoints
- change or restructure the frontend however you like

### Out of scope

- Authentication
- Design beyond plain readability
- Deployment
- Tests beyond what proves your core logic works

### Practical notes

- Everything runs locally. No cloud service or signup is needed for anything.
- We want to see **several commits along the way**, not one large commit at the end.  
  Commit as you go so we can follow your reasoning.
- Share your Github repo with "Lunke" (Kristoffer Lundquist) no later than 3 hours before the meeting.
- Bring your computer with the case to the meeting, so we can discuss it and improve it together.
